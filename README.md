Each section of this study guide lists key bullet points of what I have learned in the prework for coding bootcamp. Using the DevTools in Google Chrome, it is possible to see the elements of HTML and CSS that were employed. The Colsole tab uses javeScript to display for and if comands to randomly select a topic for study when the page is reloaded.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
